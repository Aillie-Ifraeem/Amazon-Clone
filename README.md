# Amazon-Clone
A frontend-focused Amazon Clone built primarily with **JavaScript**, replicating real-world e-commerce behavior such as product listing, cart management, quantity updates, delivery options, and checkout flow.  This project focuses on **JavaScript logic, state handling, and UI interactions**, while product data is fetched from an external backend.
